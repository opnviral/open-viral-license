# open-viral-license
There are already some viral licenses that forcibly changes type of license **your** code is released under to the viral license. GPL is one of such viral licenses: you start developing your code under MIT license, then you choose to use some library licensed under GPL - and voila, your code is under GPL license.

If this works one way, it should work another way as well.

This **Open Viral License** aims to release limitations explicitly or implicitly added to your codebase by using 3rd-party libraries or components.

It does not release any financial commitments, neither it releases any obligations to keep commercial secrets. All it does - it clears any limitations on your rights to control your own code.

There are three types of the license:

1. OVL-MIT - to release your code under MIT license
3. OVL-Apache 2.0 - to release your code under Apache 2.0 license
4. OVL-Commercial - to release your code under your cown commercial license

TODO: Explain how to use the license (add files like "OVL-MIT.lic" to the project)

TODO: Formalize license text (probably get major points from GPL-like viral licenses)
